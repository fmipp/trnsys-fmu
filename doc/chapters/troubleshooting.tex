\chapter{Troubleshooting}

In case the created FMU does not work as expected, the best way to check what happened is to take a look into the log file created by \trnsys.
This file is written in the unzipped folder of the FMU, called \texttt{<deck-file>.log}, where \texttt{<deck-file>} corresponds to the deck file name included in the FMU.
Please note, the location of this unzipped folder depends on the co-simulation environment used to access the FMU.
